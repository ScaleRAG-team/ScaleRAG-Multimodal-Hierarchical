"G. Other diﬀerences between Chinchilla and Gopher",""
"","Beyond diﬀerences in model size and number of training tokens, there are some additional minor"
"","diﬀerences between Chinchilla and Gopher. Speciﬁcally, Gopher was trained with Adam (Kingma and"
"","Ba, 2014) whereas Chinchilla was trained with AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019). Furthermore,"
"","as discussed in Lessons Learned in Rae et al. (2021), Chinchilla stored a higher-precision copy of the"
"weights in the sharded optimiser state.",""
"","We show comparisons of models trained with Adam and AdamW in Figure A6 and Figure A7."
"We ﬁnd that, independent of the learning rate schedule, AdamW trained models outperform models",""
"trained with Adam.","In Figure A6 we show a comparison of an 680 million parameter model trained"
