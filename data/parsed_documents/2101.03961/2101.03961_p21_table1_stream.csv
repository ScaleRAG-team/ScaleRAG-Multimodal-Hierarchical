"Figure 9: Data and weight partitioning strategies. Each 4×4 dotted-line grid represents 16"
"cores and the shaded squares are the data contained on that core (either model"
"weights or batch of tokens). We illustrate both how the model weights and the"
"data tensors are split
for each strategy. First Row:
illustration of how model"
"weights are split across the cores. Shapes of diﬀerent sizes in this row represent"
"larger weight matrices in the Feed Forward Network (FFN) layers (e.g larger df f"
"sizes). Each color of the shaded squares identiﬁes a unique weight matrix. The"
"number of parameters per
core
is ﬁxed, but
larger weight matrices will apply"
"more computation to each token.
Second Row:
illustration of how the data"
"batch
is
split across cores.
Each core holds
the same number of
tokens which"
"maintains a ﬁxed memory usage across all strategies. The partitioning strategies"
"have diﬀerent properties of allowing each core to either have the same tokens or"
"diﬀerent tokens across cores, which is what the diﬀerent colors symbolize."
