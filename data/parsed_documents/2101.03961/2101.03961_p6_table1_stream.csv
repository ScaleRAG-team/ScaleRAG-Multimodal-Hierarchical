"study the top-k decision and found that higher k-values in lower layers in the model were"
"important
for models with many routing layers. Contrary to these ideas, we instead use"
"a simpliﬁed strategy where we route to only a single expert. We show this simpliﬁcation"
"preserves model quality,
reduces
routing computation and performs better.
This k = 1"
"routing strategy is later referred to as a Switch layer. Note that for both MoE and Switch"
"Routing, the gate value pi(x) in Equation 2 permits diﬀerentiability of the router."
"The beneﬁts for the Switch layer are three-fold: (1) The router computation is reduced"
"as we are only routing a token to a single expert.
(2) The batch size (expert capacity) of"
"each expert can be at least halved since each token is only being routed to a single expert.3"
"(3) The routing implementation is simpliﬁed and communication costs are reduced. Figure"
"3 shows an example of routing with diﬀerent expert capacity factors."
