Selective State Space Models"
"We motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate"
"this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting"
"a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits"
"the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or"
"even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5)."

Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression"
""
"We argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state."
"view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view.
For example, attention is both effective and"
"inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference"
"requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and"
"quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state,"
"implying constant-time inference and linear-time training. However, their effectiveness is limited by how well this state"
"has compressed the context."
"To understand this principle, we focus on two running examples of synthetic tasks (Figure 2)."
"• The Selective Copying task modifies the popular Copying task (Arjovsky, Shah, and Bengio 2016) by varying the"

"It requires content-aware reasoning to be able to memorize the relevant tokens"
"(colored) and filter out the irrelevant ones (white)."
"• The Induction Heads task is a well-known mechanism hypothesized to explain the majority of in-context learning"
"abilities of LLMs (Olsson et al. 2022). It requires context-aware reasoning to know when to produce the correct output in"
"the appropriate context (black)."
"These tasks reveal the failure mode of LTI models. From the recurrent view, their constant dynamics (e.g. the (𝑨, 𝑩)"
"transitions in (2)) cannot let them select the correct information from their context, or affect the hidden state passed"
"along the sequence in an input-dependent way. From the convolutional view, it is known that global convolutions can"
"solve the vanilla Copying task (Romero et al. 2021) because it only requires time-awareness, but that they have difficulty"
"with the Selective Copying task because of lack of content-awareness (Figure 2). More concretely, the spacing between"
"inputs-to-outputs is varying and cannot be modeled by static convolution kernels."
"In summary,
the efficiency vs. effectiveness tradeoff of sequence models is characterized by how well they compress"
"their state: efficient models must have a small state, while effective models must have a state that contains all necessary"
"information from the context. In turn, we propose that a fundamental principle for building sequence models is selectivity:"
"or the context-aware ability to focus on or filter out inputs into a sequential state. In particular, a selection mechanism"
"controls how information propagates or interacts along the sequence dimension (see Section 3.5 for more discussion)."
"3.2
Improving SSMs with Selection"
"One method of incorporating a selection mechanism into models is by letting their parameters that affect interactions along"
"the sequence (e.g. the recurrent dynamics of an RNN or the convolution kernel of a CNN) be input-dependent."
"Algorithms 1 and 2 illustrates the main selection mechanism that we use. The main difference is simply making several"

"In particular, we
parameters Δ, 𝑩, 𝑪 functions of the input, along with the associated changes to tensor shapes throughout."
"highlight that these parameters now have a length dimension 𝐿, meaning that the model has changed from time-invariant"
"to time-varying. (Note that shape annotations were described in Section 2.) This loses the equivalence to convolutions (3)"
"with implications for its efficiency, discussed next."
"We specifically choose 𝑠𝐵 (𝑥) = Linear𝑁 (𝑥), 𝑠𝐶 (𝑥) = Linear𝑁 (𝑥), 𝑠Δ (𝑥) = Broadcast𝐷 (Linear1(𝑥)), and 𝜏Δ = softplus,"
"where Linear𝑑 is a parameterized projection to dimension 𝑑. The choice of 𝑠Δ and 𝜏Δ is due to a connection to RNN gating"
"mechanisms explained in Section 3.5."
