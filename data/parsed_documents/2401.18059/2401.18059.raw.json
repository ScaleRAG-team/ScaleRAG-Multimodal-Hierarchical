However, most existing methods retrieve\nonly short contiguous chunks from a retrieval corpus, limiting holistic under-\nstanding of the overall document context. We introduce the novel approach of\nrecursively embedding, clustering, and summarizing chunks of text, constructing\na tree with differing levels of summarization from the bottom up. At inference\ntime, our RAPTOR model retrieves from this tree, integrating information across\nlengthy documents at different levels of abstraction. Controlled experiments show\nthat retrieval with recursive summaries offers significant improvements over tra-\nditional retrieval-augmented LMs on several tasks. On question-answering tasks\nthat involve complex, multi-step reasoning, we show state-of-the-art results; for\nexample, by coupling RAPTOR retrieval with the use of GPT-4, we can improve\nthe best performance on the QuALITY benchmark by 20% in absolute accuracy."

      "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools showing impressive perfor-\nmance on many tasks. With the growing size of LLMs, they can serve standalone as very effective\nknowledge stores, with facts encoded within their parameters (Petroni et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2020;\nTalmor et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Bubeck et al.,\n2023; Kandpal et al., 2023) and models can be further improved with fine-tuning on downstream\ntasks (Roberts et al., 2020). Nevertheless, even a large model does not contain sufficient domain-\nspecific knowledge for particular tasks and the world continues to change, invalidating facts in the\nLLM. Updating the knowledge of these models through additional fine-tuning or editing is difficult,\nparticularly when dealing with vast text corpora (Lewis et al., 2020; Mitchell et al., 2022). An alter-\nnative approach, pioneered in open domain question answering systems (Chen et al., 2017; Yu et al.,\n2018), is to index large quantities of text, after splitting it into chunks (paragraphs), in a separate\ninformation retrieval system. Retrieved information is then presented to the LLM along with the\nquestion as context (“retrieval augmentation”, Lewis et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022; Min et al.,\n2023; Ram et al., 2023), making it easy to provide a system with current knowledge particular to\nsome domain and enabling easy interpretability and provenance tracking, whereas the parametric\nknowledge of LLMs is opaque and difficult to trace back to its source (Akyurek et al., 2022)."

The one we tackle is that\nmost existing methods retrieve only a few short, contiguous text chunks, which limits their ability\nto represent and leverage large-scale discourse structure. This is particularly relevant for thematic\nquestions that require integrating knowledge from multiple parts of a text, such as understanding\nan entire book, as in the NarrativeQA dataset (Koˇcisk`y et al., 2018). Consider the fairy tale of\nCinderella, and the question “How did Cinderella reach her happy ending?”. The top-k retrieved\nshort contiguous texts will not contain enough context to answer the question."

However, as Liu et al. (2023) and Sun et al.

This suggests that selecting the\nmost relevant information for knowledge-intensive tasks is still crucial."

      "text": "Retrieval Methods\nRetrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) have seen improvements in\nvarious components: the retriever, the reader, and end-to-end system training. Retrieval methods\nhave transitioned from traditional term-based techniques like TF-IDF (Sp¨arck Jones, 1972) and\nBM25 (Robertson et al., 1995; Roberts et al., 2020) to deep learning–based strategies (Karpukhin\net al., 2020; Khattab & Zaharia, 2020; Sachan et al., 2023). Some recent work proposes using\nlarge language models as retrievers due to their ability to memorize extensive knowledge (Yu et al.,\n2022; Sun et al., 2022). Research on the reader component includes Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD)\n(Izacard & Grave, 2022), which employs both DPR and BM25 for retrieval and processes passages\nindependently in the encoder and RETRO (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), which utilizes\ncross-chunked attention and chunkwise retrieval to generate text grounded on retrieved context."

LlamaIndex\n(Liu, 2022) mitigates this issue by similarly summarizing adjacent text chunks but also retaining\nintermediate nodes thus storing varying levels of detail, keeping granular details. However, both\nmethods, due to their reliance on adjacency for grouping or summarizing adjacent nodes, may still\noverlook distant interdependencies within the text, which we can find and group with RAPTOR."

By employing recursive clustering and summarization techniques, RAPTOR creates a\nhierarchical tree structure that is capable of synthesizing information across various sections of the\nretrieval corpora. During the query phase, RAPTOR leverages this tree structure for more effective\nretrieval. Our controlled experiments demonstrated that RAPTOR not only outperforms traditional\nretrieval methods but also sets new performance benchmarks on several question-answering tasks."

We observe that between 18.5% to 57% of the retrieved nodes come from non-leaf nodes.\nAs illustrated in Figure 7, the retrieval pattern across layers reveals the importance of RAPTOR’s\nmulti-layered tree structure. Notably, a significant percentage of the nodes retrieved by RAPTOR\nusing the DPR retriever for the NarrativeQA dataset come from the first and second layers of the\ntree, as opposed to the leaf nodes. This pattern is consistent across the other datasets and retrievers,\nalbeit with varying percentages."
