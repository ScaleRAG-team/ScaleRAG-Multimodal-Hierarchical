"The second question we examine is “What

"this question is shown in Table 13. The text retrieved by RAPTOR contains short descriptions of"

"a narrow subset of the story. Again, the difference in retrieval mechanisms affects the performance"
"of GPT-4 when answering the question. Given DPR’s context,
it outputs “The central

is"

"Fairy Godmother, transforms from a mistreated and downtrodden girl into a beautiful and confident"
"young woman who ultimately finds happiness and love with the Prince.” This is a more complete"
"answer, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the story."
"This qualitative analysis indicates that RAPTOR outperforms prior
retrieval mechanisms because"
"the information that it retrieves is more relevant and exhaustive, allowing for better performance on"
"downstream tasks."
"We also created a 2600-word story along with questions about
its narrative and theme. An excerpt"
"from the story is present below and the full PDF of this story is linked here. For questions like “What"
"is the central
theme of
the story?”, an upper-level node is retrieved which includes the sentence:"
"“This story is about
the power of human connection...
inspiring and uplifting each other as they"
"pursued their passions.” This summary, not explicitly present
in the original
text, almost directly"
"answers the question."
