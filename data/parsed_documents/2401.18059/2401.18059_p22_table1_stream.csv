"Figure 7: Histogram showing the percentage of nodes retrieved from different layers of the RAPTOR"
"tree across three datasets (NarrativeQA, Quality, and Qasper) using three retrievers (SBERT, BM25,"
"and DPR). The data indicate that a substantial portion of the nodes contributing to the final retrieval"
"comes from non-leaf layers, with a notable percentage from the first and second layers, highlighting"
"the importance of RAPTORâ€™s hierarchical summarization in the retrieval process."
