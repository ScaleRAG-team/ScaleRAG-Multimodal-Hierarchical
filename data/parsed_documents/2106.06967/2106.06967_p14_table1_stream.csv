"of the color-singlet (N ) turns out to be the homogeneous BFKL equation which leads to the power-like growth in the"
"region of small x. From these equations it follows that Mk ∝ N k at small x."
"Second, using the diﬀusion approximation for
the BFKL kernel, which is generally considered to be responsible"
"for
the small x behaviour, we show that
the factorial moments
satisfy Eq.
(2), which reproduces
the multiplicity"
"distribution of Eq. (1). This result is in agreement with the attempts [18] to ﬁnd solutions to the equations for the"
"cascade of color-singlet dipoles (see Eq. (3)."
"We also suggest a procedure for ﬁnding corrections to this multiplicity distribution, which, we believe, will be useful"
"for descriptions of the experimental data."
"In general, the multiplicity distribution, that has been discussed in the paper, conﬁrms the result of Ref.[5], that"
"the entropy of color-singlet dipoles is equal S = ln N in the region of small x, and gives the regular procedure to"
"estimate corrections to this formula."
"It
is worthwhile mentioning that both SCA and DA have been developed before and many technical
issues
that"
"matter, have been discussed3(see,
for example, Refs.[24, 37–41] and references therein)."
