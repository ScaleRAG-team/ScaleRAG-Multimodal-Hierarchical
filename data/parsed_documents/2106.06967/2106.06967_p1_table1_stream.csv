"In this paper we derived in QCD the BFKL linear,
inhomogeneous
equation for
the
factorial"
"In particular, the equation for the
moments of multiplicity distribution (Mk) from LMM equation."
"average multiplicity of the color-singlet dipoles (N ) turns out to be the homogeneous BFKL while"
"∝ N k at
small x.
Second, using the diﬀusion approximation for
the BFKL kernel we show
Mk"
"that the factorial moments are equal to: Mk = k! N (N − 1)k−1 which leads to the multiplicity"
"(cid:0) N − 1"
"1 N
σn
=
distribution:
(cid:1)n−1. We also suggest a procedure for ﬁnding corrections
to this"
"N
σin"
"multiplicity distribution which will be useful
for descriptions of the experimental data."
