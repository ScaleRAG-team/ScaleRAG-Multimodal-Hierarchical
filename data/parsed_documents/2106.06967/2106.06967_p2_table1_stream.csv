these ideas are in qualitative and, partly,
in quantitative agreement with the avail-"

it is shown in Ref.[5] that the simple cascade of color-singlet dipoles leads to the"

"The goal of this paper is to study the multiplicity distribution and the entanglement entropy in the eﬀective theory"
"for QCD at high energies (see Ref.[24]
for a general review). We have approached this problem in Refs.[5, 18] and"
"have demonstrated that Eq.
(1) arises in QCD cascades.
In this paper we analyze the multiplicity distribution for"
"Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) cascade[25]
in which one dipole at low energy generates a large number color-singlet dipoles"
"at high energy. The equation for such a cascade are known (see Refs.[24, 27–29] ) and the ﬁrst try to solve them have"
"been undertaken in Ref.[18]. However,
in this paper we return to this problem and study the multiplicity distribution"
"using the new equation (Le, Mueller and Munier (LMM) equation) for the probability generating function that has"
"been derived in Ref.[30]."
"In the next
section we derive LMM equation from the equation for
the BK parton cascade.
In the rest of
the"
"paper we discuss the equations for the factorial moments that follow from the LMM equation. We show that every"
"factorial moment
satisﬁes
the
linear but
inhomogeneous
equation with the Balitsky, Fadin, Kuraev and Lipatov"
"(BFKL) kernel[31, 32]. We attempt to solve these equations and demonstrate that in the diﬀusion approximation to"
"the BFKL kernel
factorial moments are equal to:"
"(cid:16)
(cid:17)k−1"
"N − 1
(2)
Mk = k! N"
"We show that Eq. (2) leads to Eq. (1)."
"In section VI we suggest an approach to go beyond diﬀusion approximation, which cannot give a reliable description"
"of
the
experimental data even in the
leading order of perturbative QCD.
In this approach we propose
to solve"
"exactly the
equations
for
the
factorial moments and using the diﬀerence between the
exact
solution and Eq.
(2)"
"the multiplicity distributions beyond
(∆Mk = Mk (exact) − Mk (Eq. (2))) we develop the way how to estimate"
"diﬀusion approximation.
In conclusion section we summarize our results."
