"I.
INTRODUCTION"
"During the past several years a robust relation between the principle features of high energy scattering and entangle-"
"ment properties of the hadronic wave function have been in focus of the high energy and nuclear physics communities"
"[1–19].
In this paper, we continue to explore the relation between the entropy in the parton approach[20–23] and"
"the entropy of entanglement
in a proton wave function[5].
In Ref.[5],
it
is proposed that parton distributions can"
"be deﬁned in terms of
the entropy of entanglement between the spatial
region probed by deep inelastic scattering"
"(DIS) and the rest of
the proton. This approach leads
to a simple relation S = ln N between the average number"
"of color-singlet dipoles and the entropy of the produced hadronic state S. This simple relation shows that a proton"
"becomes a maximally entangled state in the region of small Bjorken x. All these conclusions were made from esti-"
"mates in the simple, even naive model
for QCD cascade of color-singlet dipoles. However,
it has been demonstrated"
