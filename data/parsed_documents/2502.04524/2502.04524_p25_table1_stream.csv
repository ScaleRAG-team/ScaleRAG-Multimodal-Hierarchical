Intra and inter-device variability"
"By extracting the standard deviation of the minimum conductance step size (σ∆Gsp )"
"from the experimental traces and incorporating it into the simulation’s device model,"
"the device response intrinsically includes noise from cycle to cycle. This provides a real-"
"istic device behavior with intra-device variability. Furthermore,
the network devices"
"shall
include inter-device variabilities to perform physically accurate simulations. To"
"achieve this, two multi-variate Gaussian distributions, G1 and G2, are created (see Fig."
"S9 in Supplementary Information). G1 is extracted from the experimentally obtained"
"(which accounts for variations across devices in the G-range and
parameters: Nstates"
"step) and SP in the normalized G-range, whereas G2 is fitted to the analytical model"
"parameters obtained from the fitted generalized SBM (γ and γup down). Therefore, vari-"
"ables from G1 showed statistical
independence from those of G2. New device instances"
"are independently sampled from the two Gaussian distributions to represent synapses"
"on the DNN layers. The instantiated CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices include variations in"
"the device response, conductance ranges, and asymmetrical behavior, thus providing"
"a more hardware-aware and realistic scenario for analog training simulation."
