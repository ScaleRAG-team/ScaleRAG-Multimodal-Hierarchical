"An all-in-one technology platform based on analog filamentary CMO/HfOx ReRAM"
"devices is presented. This platform addresses critical challenges in modern digital AI"
"accelerators by overcoming the physical
separation between memory and compute"
"units.
It enables
the execution of
forward and backward MVMs, along with weight"
"updates and gradient computations, directly on a unified analog in-memory platform"
"with O(1) time complexity. This all-in-one approach fundamentally differs from DNN"
"inference-only
[9]
and training-only
[24,
41]
analog
accelerators.
In inference-only"
"accelerators, DNN weights are
trained in software
(i.e., off-chip) using traditional"
"digital CPUs
or GPUs
and then programmed once
onto
the
analog AI hardware"
"accelerator.
In training-only accelerators,
the
long-term retention capabilities
and"
"overall MVM accuracy for
large array tiles are not assessed.
In this work, a novel"
"all-in-one analog computing platform, capable of both on-chip training and inference"
"acceleration,
is unveiled."
"The CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices are integrated in the BEOL of a NMOS transistor"
"platform in a
scalable
1T1R array
architecture. The highly
reproducible
forming"
"step demonstrates
compatibility with NMOS rated for
3.3 V operation, while
the"
"uniform quasi-static
8W-cycling
characteristics,
achieved with
voltage
amplitudes"
"of
less
than ± 1.5 V, exhibit a significant conductance window and a low off-state."
"The multi-bit
capability of more
than 32
states
(5 bits), distinguishable
after
10"
"minutes with less
than 10% overlap error,
is experimentally demonstrated using an"
"identical-pulse closed-loop scheme. The characterization of the weight transfer reveals"
"record-low programming noise ranging from 10 nS to 100 nS, more than one order of"
"magnitude
lower
than that of other memristive
technologies
targeting similar
con-"
"ductance ranges [34–36]. Each conductance distribution exhibits a state-independent"
"relaxation process over time, characterized by a slight shift of the mean toward lower"
"conductance and an increase
in the
standard deviation. This
independence of
the"
"relaxation process
from the
target
conductance
is
advantageous
for
implementing"
"effective compensation schemes in the future."
"Realistic MVM simulations on a 64x64 array tile, considering CMO/HfOx ReRAM"
"device non-idealities such as finite weight transfer resolution, conductance relaxation,"
"limited input/output quantization, and IR-drop across array wires,
show an RMSE"
"as low as 0.2 compared to the ideal FP-case, even 10 years after programming. This"
"demonstrates
that
improve analog MVM accuracy
the CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices"
"by a factor of 20 and 3 compared to the state of the art [9], 1 second and 10 years after"
"programming, respectively. Although this study was performed at room temperature,"
"previous characterization of a similar CMO/HfOx ReRAM stack demonstrated the"
"thermal
stability of
the analog states at high temperature (less
than 4% drift after"
"72 hours at 85 °C)[24]. Future studies will
focus on incorporating the experimental"
"characterized between 0.2% and 2% of
read noise of CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices,"
"similar
conductance
range
as used in this work [25],
into MVM
G target within a"
"accuracy simulations. Although read noise is not
included in the MVM simulations"
"of this study, no significant additional drop in MVM accuracy is anticipated. In fact,"
