"4.1 Device fabrication"
"The CMO/HfOx ReRAM array is based on 1T1R unit cells. In this configuration, the"
"bottom electrode of the ReRAM device is connected in series to the drain of an n-type"
"metal–oxide–semiconductor (NMOS) selector transistor. The transistor blocks sneak"
"paths and ensures current compliance during electro-forming and programming of the"
"ReRAM device. The NMOS transistors, rated for 3.3 V operation, are fabricated using"
"a standard 130 nm foundry process with copper BEOL interconnects. The ReRAM"
"devices are integrated on metal-8 layer. To prevent the oxidation of the copper vias"
"during the ReRAM stack deposition,
the 70 nm thick silicon nitride (SiNx) passiva-"
"tion layer from the foundry is used as a protective layer. On top of that, a 20 nm thick"
"titanium nitride (TiN) bottom electrode and a 4 nm thick hafnium oxide (HfOx) lay-"
"ers are deposited by Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition (PEALD) process at"
"300 °C, while maintaining vacuum conditions to avoid oxidation of the TiN layer. Sub-"
"sequently, a stack of layers consisting of a 20 nm thick conductive metal-oxide (CMO),"
"a 20 nm thick titanium nitride (TiN), and a 50 nm thick tungsten (W)
is deposited"
"by sputtering and patterned through a lithography step. A 100 nm thick silicon oxide"
"layer
is
sputtered as passivation. The passivation layer
is
then patterned to
(SiOx)"
"expose the W top electrode and the copper via in the metal-8 layer beneath the bottom"
"electrode. The ReRAM fabrication is completed using a titanium/gold lift-off process."
"In this approach, the TiN bottom electrode is connected to the metal-8 via through"
"its vertical sidewalls using gold. The ReRAM BEOL patterning steps are performed"
"through mask-based photolithography performed on a 6×6 mm2 die issued from a"
"Multi Project Wafer (MPW). The area of the CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices presented"
"in this work is 12×12 µm2. Previous
studies on CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices have"
"demonstrated scalability down to 200×200 nm2
[24–26]. Due to their filament-type"
"nature, the performance of the ReRAM devices presented in this work is expected to"
"remain similar for smaller areas."
"4.2 ReRAM forming modelling"
"A 3D FEM of
the forming event,
is used to
the CMO/HfOx ReRAM device, after"
"simulate electronic transport by solving the continuity (4) and the Joule-heating (5)"
"equations in steady state:"
