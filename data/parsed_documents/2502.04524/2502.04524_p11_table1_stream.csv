to estimate the MVM accuracy over
time.
In analog ReRAM devices, a sig-"
"nificant
conductance
relaxation has been observed immediately after programming"
"(within 1 second) [9]. Following this initial abrupt conductance change, the relaxation"
"process
slows
considerably [9,
37]. The physical
cause
of
retention degradation is"
"attributed to the Brownian motion of defects
in the
resistive
switching layer
[37]."
"In this
section,
the
conductance
relaxation of
the CMO/HfOx ReRAM array after"
"programming is characterized. Fig. 4a shows the relaxation of the distributions pre-"
"viously reported in Fig. 3a, approximately 10 minutes after programming. The 35"
"levels remain distinguishable 10 minutes after programming, with an average overlap"
"of 9.6% between adjacent
states gaussians, while the average standard deviation of"
"the distributions increases to 0.6 µS, showing almost independence from the G target"
"(see Fig. 4b)."
"The stability of the CMO/HfOx ReRAM conductance states is further assessed on a"
"longer time-scale, up to 1 hour. To achieve so, a linearly spaced G target vector within"
"the experimental conductance range of 10 µS to 90 µS is defined, with a fine step of"
"0.2 µS (400 points). Each G target value is programmed into a single ReRAM device"
"within the array. Due to the size mismatch between the array (32 devices) and the"
"G target vector (size 400), multiple measurement batches are needed. Fig. 4c shows the"
"experimental relaxation of the 400 programmed states within the entire conductance"
"window,
1
second and 1 hour
after programming,
executed with the
closed-loop"
"scheme (see ”Methods” section ”Identical-pulse closed-loop scheme” for details) and"
"induced by
with a 0.2% G target acceptance range. The exhibited conductance error"
"is plotted as a function
the relaxation process after 1 hour, computed as G1h − Gprog.,"
"of
the programmed conductances
in Fig. 4d. After 1 hour, although both positive"
"and negative
relaxation errors are
recorded, an average decrease
in conductance
is"
"observed across
all programmed states, with a
relaxation error
averaging
around"
"-0.7 µS. This highlights
that
the relaxation process
in CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices"
"leads, on average, to a decrease in the mean and an increase in the standard deviation"
"of
the Gaussian distributions
regardless of
the
initial
conductance
state. Since
the"
"absolute magnitudes of
the mean decrease and the standard deviation increase are"
"independent of G target, an extended characterization of the relaxation process up to"
"1 week is conducted for a representative conductance state (50 µS). To achieve this,"
"identical-pulse
the array’s CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices are programmed using the"
"closed-loop scheme to G target of 50 µS, with a 0.2% G target acceptance range. Fig."
"4e illustrates
the experimental array relaxation over 1 week. The insets display the"
"evolution of both the mean and standard deviation as a function of the logarithm of"
"time after programming (in seconds), using a linear fit
to predict
the conductance"
"distribution over a 10-year period."
"To assess the accuracy of analog MVM, a comprehensive set of non-idealities—both"
"intrinsic to CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices and at the architecture level—is considered,"
"including finite programming
