"The
underlying
physical mechanism behind

in
analog"
"31,
32]. The
current
CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices has been recently unveiled [26,"
"transport is explained by a trap-to-trap tunneling process, and the resistive switching"
"by a modulation of
the defect density within the conductive sub-band of
the CMO"
"that behaves
as

In these works,"

the analog CMO/HfOx ReRAM device shows a counter-eightwise (C8W)"
"polarity, according to the definition proposed in literature [33]. The intrinsically grad-"
"ual reset
(from low to high resistance) process, marked by a temperature decrease,"
"occurs during the positive voltage
sweep on the ReRAM top electrode, while
the"
"exponential set
(from high to low resistance) process,
involving a rapid temperature"
"increase, occurs on the negative
side
[26]. However, when arranged in a 1T1R cell"
"configuration based on an NMOS selector, the C8W switching polarity prevents direct"
"control of
the
exponential
set
process. This
results
in
transistor’s VGS during the"
"reduced switching uniformity, which is critical
for the array-level adoption of analog"
"CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices."
"For
this
reason,
in this work the
analog CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices within the"
"1T1R cells are optimized to exhibit the desirable 8W switching polarity by extending"
"the current switching model
in literature [26]. To achieve this,
following the positive"
"forming and the initial negative voltage sweep, each device in the array is subjected"
"to a forward and backward voltage
sweep from 0 to −1.5 V. During this process,"
