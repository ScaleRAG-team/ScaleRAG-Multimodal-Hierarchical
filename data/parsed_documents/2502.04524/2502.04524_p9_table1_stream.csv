"the number of

In the Supplementary Information, Fig. S5a shows"
"the experimental cumulative distribution of conductance values for the same 35 rep-"
"resentative levels presented in Fig. 3a, but using 2% G target as acceptance range. The"
"standard deviation of the representative conductance levels is extracted and fitted as"
"a linear
function of
the target conductance (dashed lines), as
shown in Fig. 3e,
for"
"both acceptance ranges. For all conductance levels, a standard deviation of
less than"
"0.1 µS (1 µS)
the acceptance
is achieved considering 0.2% G target
(2% G target) as"
"range. This is more than one order of magnitude lower compared to other memristive"
"technologies,
such as phase-change memory
(PCM)
arrays,
targeting

"achieve an almost ideal weight transfer during programming, enabling the distinction"
"of more than 32 states (5 bits)."
