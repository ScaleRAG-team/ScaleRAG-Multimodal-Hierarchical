"4.5 Identical-pulse closed-loop scheme"
"The procedure begins with a quasi-static voltage
sweep from 0 to −1.5 V to reset"
"each cell within the array to the HRS. Subsequently, a closed-loop scheme is initiated,"
"which iteratively repeats the following two steps until convergence to G target within an"
"acceptance range: (1) read the conductance of the ReRAM cell, and (2) if the measured"
"value is below (above) the target conductance, apply a set (reset) programming pulse."
"During this iterative process, the cell conductance may fluctuate multiple times before"
"eventually reaching the acceptance range. Starting from the HRS,
this procedure is"
"applied to the CMO/HfOx ReRAM array to sequentially program 35 representative"
"conductance
levels,
ranging from approximately 10 µS to 90 µS, using acceptance"
"ranges of both 0.2% G target and 2% G target. Unlike the conventional incremental-pulse"
"closed-loop technique previously used for ReRAM [9, 43], where the amplitudes of set"
"and reset pulses are gradually increased to achieve convergence, this work employs an"
"identical-pulse closed-loop scheme to simplify the pulse generation circuitry design,"
"using only two fixed amplitude values for the set (1.35 V or 1.5 V) and two for the reset"
"(−1.3 V or −1.5 V) pulses. Specifically, depending on G target, three ranges are used:"
"from approximately 10 µS to 30 µS with Vset = 1.35 V and Vreset = −1.5 V; from 30 µS"
"to 60 µS Vset = 1.35 V and Vreset = −1.3 V ; and from 60 µS to 90 µS Vset = 1.5 V and"
"the flowchart of
the
Vreset = −1.3 V. Fig. S5b in Supplementary Information shows"
"identical-pulse closed-loop technique used in this work. The set/reset pulse width is"
"fixed at 2.5 µs due to setup limitations, even though previous work has demonstrated"
"CMO/HfOx ReRAM switching with pulse width as short as 60 ns [25]. The reading"
"pulse amplitude and width are Vread = 0.2 V and 300 µs, respectively. During the set,"
"reset, and read operations of each 1T1R cell, the transistor’s gate voltage is controlled"
"with constant values of VG equal to 1.4 V, 3.3 V, and 3.3 V, respectively."
"4.6 HW-aware simulation of analog MVM"
"The ’aihwkit’
[44]
simulation tool was used to perform MVM assessments
including"
"non-ideal behaviors and noise, and their
effect on the
computation accuracy with"
"respect to floating-point operations. The MVM simulation included the exhibited pro-"
"gramming noise, conductance relaxation,
input and output quantization, and IR-drop"
"across array wires. The ’aihwkit’ allows to configure such noisy effects for dedicated"
"memristive devices such as PCM by Nandakumar et al. [45] and ReRAM by Wan et al."
"[9]. Therefore, a unique phenomenological noise model for CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices"
"for
inference is developed to incorporate into the simulation both the characterized"
"programming noise and conductance relaxation. Additionally,
input and output are"
"quantized with 6-bit and 8-bit resolution, respectively, and the IR-drop is considered,"
"with 100 µS as the maximum ReRAM conductance level and a default segment wire"
"resistance of 0.35 Ω."
"4.6.1 Modelling the programming noise"
"For a target
the device’s programmed conductance
is defined
conductance G target,"
"as the target value plus normally distributed noise with a standard deviation σprog,"
"which is a function of G target. As depicted in Fig. 3e, the programming noise (σprog)"
