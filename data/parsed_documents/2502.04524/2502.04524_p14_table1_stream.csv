"weight changes. Analog CMO/HfOx ReRAM arrays not only allow for bidirectional"
"conductance updates, but additionally enable parallel weight updating by following"
"a stochastic open-loop pulse scheme [20, 21]. Remarkably, the parallel and open-loop"
"update scheme significantly accelerates
training compared to serial and closed-loop"
"methods, providing efficiency gains of several orders of magnitude and advantages in"
"system design complexity [39].
In this
section,
the bidirectional open-loop response"
"of
required during Tiki-Taka training,
is character-
the CMO/HfOx ReRAM array,"
"ized. Specifically, the analog conductance potentiation, depression and symmetry point"
"are measured. Subsequently,
the devices’
responses
are
statistically reproduced in"
"the open-source
’aihwkit’
simulation platform developed by IBM [38]. Finally,
this"
"hardware-aware device model, which includes device variabilities,
is used to simulate"
"the training of
representative neural networks using the AGAD learning algorithm."
"This novel analog training algorithm relaxes the symmetry requirements of previous"
"Tiki-Taka versions by incorporating additional digital computations on-the-fly [23]."
"2.3.1 Open-loop ReRAM array characterization"
"Fig. 5a shows the experimental conductance change of a representative CMO/HfOx"
"ReRAM device within the array upon applying identical-voltage pulse
trains with"
"alternating polarity in batches of 400. Subsequently, a sequence of 500 pulses with"
"alternating polarity, consisting of 1-pulse-up followed by 1-pulse-down,
is applied to"
"experimentally determine
the
symmetry point. The
same
open-loop programming"
"scheme, with Vset = 1.35 V (VG = 1.4 V) and Vreset = −1.3 V (VG = 3.3 V), each last-"
"ing 2.5 µs, is applied to all devices in the 8x4 array. The set/reset pulse width is limited"
"by the
experimental
setup, although previous work has demonstrated CMO/HfOx"
"ReRAM switching with pulses as
short as 60 ns
[25]. Due
to inter-device
(device-"
"to-device) and intra-device (cycle-to-cycle) variabilities, the experimental response of"
"each device to a given number of
identical pulses exhibits
some level of variability"
"(see Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Information). Therefore, for each pulse, a Gaussian"
"distribution of the measured conductance states among the devices is extracted. For"
"statistical relevance, Fig. 5b shows the experimental standard deviation of the array"
"response to the open-loop scheme as a function of the pulse number, represented in"
"grey. To realistically assess the accuracy of analog training with CMO/HfOx ReRAM"
"devices, the key figures of merit of the device training characterization—such as the"
"number of states, the symmetry point skew, and the noise-to-signal ratio (NSR)—are"
"first extracted from experimental data, as defined below."
