"2.2 Analog inference with CMO/HfOx ReRAM core"
"Here, the experimental characterization of the key metrics of the CMO/HfOx ReRAM"
"array relevant to inference performance is presented. Specifically, the continuous con-"

capability is demonstrated over
a
range
spanning
approximately"
"one order of magnitude. The
trade-off between weight
transfer programming noise"
"required iterations
for programming
of CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices and number of"
"convergence is analyzed across different acceptance ranges. Furthermore, conductance"
"relaxation—defined as
the change in conductance over
time after programming—is"
"characterized. Finally,
the
combined impact of weight

"analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and IR drop on the array wires is evaluated with"

"2.2.1 Weight transfer accuracy"
"In memristor-based AIMC inference
accelerators,
pre-trained
normalized weights"
"are
initially mapped into
target
conductances
and subsequently programmed into"
"hardware
in an iterative process known as weight
transfer. This
iterative process,"
"which stops once the programmed conductance converges to the target value within"
"a defined acceptance range,
inherently introduces an error due to the analog nature"
"of
conductance weights. This
error, described by
a normal distribution with the"
"leads to a drop in MVM
standard deviation referred to as programming noise (σprog),"
"accuracy. To quantify this non-ideality,
the non-volatile multi-level capability of
the"
"the experimental cumu-
CMO/HfOx ReRAM array is characterized. Fig. 3a shows"
"lative distribution of conductance values
for 35 representative levels, with all
states"
"sharply separated and without any overlap. Fig. 3b shows a schematic representation"
"of
the closed-loop (i.e., program-verify)
scheme, where identical
set
and reset pulse"
"trains are employed to program each ReRAM cell to its target conductance within a"
"desired acceptance range (see ”Methods” section ”Identical-pulse closed-loop scheme”"
"for details). Selecting programming conditions
involves a fundamental
trade-off: a"
"narrower acceptance range can improve programming precision by reducing program-"
"ming noise, but
it
increases
the number of
iterations
required for convergence (see"
"Fig. 3d). Besides the longer programming time, other non-idealities to consider when"
"choosing the acceptance range are (1) the conductance relaxation immediately after"
"programming, which is characterized in 2.2.2 for CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices, and"
"(2) read noise, which has already been characterized between 0.2% and 2% of G target"
"for CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices [25] within a similar conductance range used in this"
"work."
"The trade-off between the programming noise and the number of
iterations
is char-"
"acterized for two representative acceptance range intervals: 0.2% and 2% of G target,"
"respectively. Fig. 3c illustrates the experimental number of pulses needed to converge"
"to the G target using the two representative acceptance ranges. On average, each cell"
"requires approximately 11 and 89 set/reset pulses
for acceptance ranges of 2% and"
"respectively. Since the acceptance range is defined as a percentage
0.2% of G target,"
