      "text": "Analog in-memory computing is an emerging paradigm designed to efficiently\naccelerate deep neural network workloads. Recent advancements have focused on\neither inference or training acceleration. However, a unified analog in-memory\ntechnology platform—capable of on-chip training, weight retention, and long-\nterm inference acceleration—has yet to be reported. This work presents an\nall-in-one analog AI accelerator, combining these capabilities to enable energy-\nefficient, continuously adaptable AI systems. The platform leverages an array\nof analog filamentary conductive-metal-oxide (CMO)/HfOx resistive switching\nmemory cells (ReRAM) integrated into the back-end-of-line (BEOL). The array\ndemonstrates reliable resistive switching with voltage amplitudes below 1.5 V,\ncompatible with advanced technology nodes. The array’s multi-bit capability\n(over 32 stable states) and low programming noise (down to 10 nS) enable a nearly\nideal weight transfer process, more than an order of magnitude better than other\nmemristive technologies. Inference performance is validated through matrix-\nvector multiplication simulations on a 64×64 array, achieving a root-mean-square\nerror improvement by a factor of 20 at 1 second and 3 at 10 years after pro-\ngramming, compared to state-of-the-art. Training accuracy closely matching the\nsoftware equivalent is achieved across different datasets. The CMO/HfOx ReRAM"

      "text": "Modern computing systems rely on von Neumann architectures, where instructions\nand data must be transferred between memory and the processing unit to perform\ncomputational tasks. This data transfer, particularly recurrent and massive in promi-\nnent artificial intelligence (AI)-related workloads, results in significant latency and\nenergy overhead [1]. Digital AI accelerators address this challenge through compu-\ntational parallelism, bringing memory closer to the processing units, and exploiting\napplication-specific processors [2, 3]. This approach has demonstrated to bring signif-\nicant improvements in throughput and efficiency for running deep neural networks\n(DNNs) [4], but the physical separation between memory and compute units persists.\nAnalog in-memory computing (AIMC) [5] is a promising approach to eliminate this\nseparation and so achieve further power and efficiency improvements in deep-learning\nworkloads [6], by enabling some arithmetic and logic operations to be performed\ndirectly at the location where the data is stored. By mapping the weights of DNNs\nonto crossbar arrays of resistive devices and by leveraging Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s\nphysical laws, matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs)—the most recurrent operation\nin AI-workloads [7]—are performed in memory with O(1) time complexity [4, 5, 8].\nRecent demonstrations of the AIMC paradigm have primarily focused on accelerating\nthe inference step of digitally trained DNNs [9–12]. However, the increasing com-\nputing demands of modern AI models make the training phase orders of magnitude\nmore costly in time and expenses than inference, highlighting the need for efficient\nhardware acceleration based on the AIMC paradigm. For instance, Gemini 1.0 Ultra\nrequired over 5 · 1025 floating-point operations (FLOPs), approximately 100 days,\n24 MW of power, and an estimated cost of 30 million dollars for training [13]."

This process leads to the formation of a highly defect-rich conductive filament\nin the HfOx layer. Due to the high oxygen vacancy (V··\nO in Kr¨oger–Vink notation [28])\nformation energy, ranging from 2.8 eV to 4.6 eV in HfOx depending on the stoichiome-\ntry [29, 30], defect generation occurs with statistical relevance only during the forming\nsweep within the HfOx layer [26]. The subsequent application of a negative voltage\nsweep up to −1.4 V, with a constant VG = 3.3 V, induces a radial redistribution of\nthe defects within the CMO layer, consistent with findings in literature [26]. This pro-\ncess leads to an increase of the ReRAM conductance and is modelled by considering a\nconstant average radius of the conductive filament, with a local electrical conductiv-\nity increase of the CMO layer on top of the filament.

      "text": "In memristor-based AIMC inference accelerators, pre-trained normalized weights\nare initially mapped into target conductances and subsequently programmed into\nhardware in an iterative process known as weight transfer. This iterative process,\nwhich stops once the programmed conductance converges to the target value within\na defined acceptance range, inherently introduces an error due to the analog nature\nof conductance weights. This error, described by a normal distribution with the\nstandard deviation referred to as programming noise (σprog), leads to a drop in MVM\naccuracy. To quantify this non-ideality, the non-volatile multi-level capability of the\nCMO/HfOx ReRAM array is characterized. Fig. 3a shows the experimental cumu-\nlative distribution of conductance values for 35 representative levels, with all states\nsharply separated and without any overlap. Fig. 3b shows a schematic representation\nof the closed-loop (i.e., program-verify) scheme, where identical set and reset pulse\ntrains are employed to program each ReRAM cell to its target conductance within a\ndesired acceptance range (see ”Methods” section ”Identical-pulse closed-loop scheme”\nfor details). Selecting programming conditions involves a fundamental trade-off: a\nnarrower acceptance range can improve programming precision by reducing program-\nming noise, but it increases the number of iterations required for convergence (see\nFig. 3d). Besides the longer programming time, other non-idealities to consider when\nchoosing the acceptance range are (1) the conductance relaxation immediately after\nprogramming, which is characterized in 2.2.2 for CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices, and\n(2) read noise, which has already been characterized between 0.2% and 2% of Gtarget\nfor CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices [25] within a similar conductance range used in this\nwork."

      "text": "of Gtarget, the number of iterations required for convergence is almost independent\nof the target conductance value. In the Supplementary Information, Fig. S5a shows\nthe experimental cumulative distribution of conductance values for the same 35 rep-\nresentative levels presented in Fig. 3a, but using 2% Gtarget as acceptance range. The\nstandard deviation of the representative conductance levels is extracted and fitted as\na linear function of the target conductance (dashed lines), as shown in Fig. 3e, for\nboth acceptance ranges. For all conductance levels, a standard deviation of less than\n0.1 µS (1 µS) is achieved considering 0.2% Gtarget (2% Gtarget) as the acceptance\nrange. This is more than one order of magnitude lower compared to other memristive\ntechnologies, such as phase-change memory (PCM) arrays, targeting similar con-\nductance ranges [34–36]. These results demonstrate that CMO/HfOx ReRAM cells\nachieve an almost ideal weight transfer during programming, enabling the distinction\nof more than 32 states (5 bits)."

The physical cause of retention degradation is\nattributed to the Brownian motion of defects in the resistive switching layer [37].\nIn this section, the conductance relaxation of the CMO/HfOx ReRAM array after\nprogramming is characterized.

To achieve so, a linearly spaced Gtarget vector within\nthe experimental conductance range of 10 µS to 90 µS is defined, with a fine step of\n0.2 µS (400 points). Each Gtarget value is programmed into a single ReRAM device\nwithin the array. Due to the size mismatch between the array (32 devices) and the\nGtarget vector (size 400), multiple measurement batches are needed. Fig. 4c shows the\nexperimental relaxation of the 400 programmed states within the entire conductance\nwindow, 1 second and 1 hour after programming, executed with the closed-loop\nscheme (see ”Methods” section ”Identical-pulse closed-loop scheme” for details) and\nwith a 0.2% Gtarget acceptance range. The exhibited conductance error induced by\nthe relaxation process after 1 hour, computed as G1h −Gprog., is plotted as a function\nof the programmed conductances in Fig. 4d. After 1 hour, although both positive\nand negative relaxation errors are recorded, an average decrease in conductance is\nobserved across all programmed states, with a relaxation error averaging around\n-0.7 µS. This highlights that the relaxation process in CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices\nleads, on average, to a decrease in the mean and an increase in the standard deviation\nof the Gaussian distributions regardless of the initial conductance state. Since the\nabsolute magnitudes of the mean decrease and the standard deviation increase are\nindependent of Gtarget, an extended characterization of the relaxation process up to\n1 week is conducted for a representative conductance state (50 µS). To achieve this,\nthe array’s CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices are programmed using the identical-pulse\nclosed-loop scheme to Gtarget of 50 µS, with a 0.2% Gtarget acceptance range. Fig.\n4e illustrates the experimental array relaxation over 1 week. The insets display the\nevolution of both the mean and standard deviation as a function of the logarithm of\ntime after programming (in seconds), using a linear fit to predict the conductance\ndistribution over a 10-year period."

Considering the input and output quantization of 6-bit\nand 8-bit respectively, the inset illustrates the time evolution of the root-mean-square\nerror (RMSE) of the simulated analog MVM compared to the FP expected result.\nThese results show that the CMO/HfOx ReRAM core enables accurate MVM oper-\nations, achieving an RMSE ranging from 0.03 at 1 second to 0.2 at 10 years after\nprogramming, compared to the ideal FP case. Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Informa-\ntion illustrates the impact of IR-drop and input/output quantization on the RMSE\nof an MVM performed on a 64×64 array. Over short time scales (within 1 hour), the\nprimary accuracy bottleneck is the limited input/output quantization of 6-bit and 8-\nbit, respectively. Over longer periods, relaxation effects become the dominant source\nof non-ideality. In a larger 512×512 array, IR-drop emerges as the main accuracy\nbottleneck for analog MVM. Compared to the analog ReRAMs studied by Wan et\nal. [9], who report an experimentally determined RMSE of approximately 0.58 under\nconditions similar to those of this work, CMO/HfOx ReRAMs demonstrate a poten-\ntial improvement in MVM accuracy by a factor of 20 and 3, 1 second and 10 years\nafter programming, respectively.

Analog CMO/HfOx ReRAM arrays not only allow for bidirectional\nconductance updates, but additionally enable parallel weight updating by following\na stochastic open-loop pulse scheme [20, 21]. Remarkably, the parallel and open-loop\nupdate scheme significantly accelerates training compared to serial and closed-loop\nmethods, providing efficiency gains of several orders of magnitude and advantages in\nsystem design complexity [39]. In this section, the bidirectional open-loop response\nof the CMO/HfOx ReRAM array, required during Tiki-Taka training, is character-\nized. Specifically, the analog conductance potentiation, depression and symmetry point\nare measured. Subsequently, the devices’ responses are statistically reproduced in\nthe open-source ’aihwkit’ simulation platform developed by IBM [38]. Finally, this\nhardware-aware device model, which includes device variabilities, is used to simulate\nthe training of representative neural networks using the AGAD learning algorithm.\nThis novel analog training algorithm relaxes the symmetry requirements of previous\nTiki-Taka versions by incorporating additional digital computations on-the-fly [23]."

Subsequently, a sequence of 500 pulses with\nalternating polarity, consisting of 1-pulse-up followed by 1-pulse-down, is applied to\nexperimentally determine the symmetry point. The same open-loop programming\nscheme, with Vset = 1.35 V (VG = 1.4 V) and Vreset = −1.3 V (VG = 3.3 V), each last-\ning 2.5 µs, is applied to all devices in the 8x4 array. The set/reset pulse width is limited\nby the experimental setup, although previous work has demonstrated CMO/HfOx\nReRAM switching with pulses as short as 60 ns [25]. Due to inter-device (device-\nto-device) and intra-device (cycle-to-cycle) variabilities, the experimental response of\neach device to a given number of identical pulses exhibits some level of variability\n(see Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Information). Therefore, for each pulse, a Gaussian\ndistribution of the measured conductance states among the devices is extracted. For\nstatistical relevance, Fig. 5b shows the experimental standard deviation of the array\nresponse to the open-loop scheme as a function of the pulse number, represented in\ngrey. To realistically assess the accuracy of analog training with CMO/HfOx ReRAM\ndevices, the key figures of merit of the device training characterization—such as the\nnumber of states, the symmetry point skew, and the noise-to-signal ratio (NSR)—are\nfirst extracted from experimental data, as defined below."

Fig.\n5c shows the experimental Gaussian distributions of these metrics for the 32 devices\nwithin the array. The results indicate an average of 22 states, with a range from 16 to\n33. A shift in the Gsp (or SPskew) of 61% is measured, reflecting a negative trend in\nthe device asymmetry where the down response is steeper than the up response. An\naverage NSR of 90% among the devices is obtained, demonstrating the capability to\ndiscriminate between pulses up and down around the symmetry point. This parameter\nreflects the intrinsic noise on the device’s response under identical conditions, high-\nlighting an intra-device variation [38]. Previous studies on similar CMO/HfOx ReRAM\nsystems [24] extracted these metrics from isolated 1R devices using an optimized open-\nloop scheme tailored to each device.

Additionally, Gaussian distributions are modelled based on parameters\nextracted from device characterization (Gmax, Gmin, ∆Gsp, NSR, SPskew) to account\nfor device-to-device variability observed in the experimental characterization (see\n”Methods” section ”Intra and inter-device variability” for details). This Gaussian\nfitting approach allows defining various device presets—characterized by the same\nmodel but with different parameter settings—to represent the synapses across the\nneural network. A realistic simulation setup is obtained by exclusively considering\nexperimentally obtained parameters to reproduce the device trace (see ”Methods”\nsection ”Generalized soft bounds model” for details). The device model is defined\nbased on the observed conductance window and number of states, without assuming\nasymptotic behavior for an infinite number of pulses. This prevents overestimation of\nboth the conductance window and the number of states (material states), enhancing\nthe fidelity of the simulation."

In addition, the impact of the device’s number of states, asymmetry, and\nnoise-to-signal ratio on accuracy and convergence time is evaluated by simulating\nidentical networks in which each property is individually enhanced, while keeping the\nothers fixed at the experimentally derived values. Literature has shown that these\ndevice characteristics critically influence the convergence of analog training algo-\nrithms [23]. Therefore, this method assesses the deviation of the current CMO/HfOx\nReRAM device properties from the ideal analog resistive device scenario. Moreover, to\nshow the scalability of the CMO/HfOx ReRAM technology to more computationally-\nintensive tasks, such as time series processing, a 2-layer long short-term memory\n(LSTM) network was trained on War and Peace text sequences to predict the next\ntoken. Each network is initially trained using conventional stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) based backpropagation with 32-bit FP precision, serving as the baseline per-\nformance. Fig. 6b illustrates the accuracy per epoch for the FP-baseline trained with\nSGD (in green) and the analog network trained using AGAD, evaluated under four\ndifferent parameter settings: (1) properties extracted from the experimental array\n(in yellow), (2) reduced NSR to 20% (in red), (3) average of Nstates = 100 states (in\nblue), and (4) zero average device asymmetry (in orange). Using symmetrical device\npresets, i.e. with an average SPskew of 50%, improves accuracy by 0.7% with respect\nto analog training with CMO/HfOx ReRAM experimentally derived configuration\n(96.9%), landing an accuracy of 97.6%, a 0.7% lower than the FP-SGD baseline\n(98.3%). The other two configurations show less performance improvement, indicating\nmore resilience of the AGAD-training to device’s Nstates and NSR."

In this configuration, the\nbottom electrode of the ReRAM device is connected in series to the drain of an n-type\nmetal–oxide–semiconductor (NMOS) selector transistor. The transistor blocks sneak\npaths and ensures current compliance during electro-forming and programming of the\nReRAM device. The NMOS transistors, rated for 3.3 V operation, are fabricated using\na standard 130 nm foundry process with copper BEOL interconnects. The ReRAM\ndevices are integrated on metal-8 layer. To prevent the oxidation of the copper vias\nduring the ReRAM stack deposition, the 70 nm thick silicon nitride (SiNx) passiva-\ntion layer from the foundry is used as a protective layer. On top of that, a 20 nm thick\ntitanium nitride (TiN) bottom electrode and a 4 nm thick hafnium oxide (HfOx) lay-\ners are deposited by Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition (PEALD) process at\n300 °C, while maintaining vacuum conditions to avoid oxidation of the TiN layer. Sub-\nsequently, a stack of layers consisting of a 20 nm thick conductive metal-oxide (CMO),\na 20 nm thick titanium nitride (TiN), and a 50 nm thick tungsten (W) is deposited\nby sputtering and patterned through a lithography step. A 100 nm thick silicon oxide\n(SiOx) layer is sputtered as passivation. The passivation layer is then patterned to\nexpose the W top electrode and the copper via in the metal-8 layer beneath the bottom\nelectrode. The ReRAM fabrication is completed using a titanium/gold lift-off process.\nIn this approach, the TiN bottom electrode is connected to the metal-8 via through\nits vertical sidewalls using gold. The ReRAM BEOL patterning steps are performed\nthrough mask-based photolithography performed on a 6×6 mm2 die issued from a\nMulti Project Wafer (MPW). The area of the CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices presented\nin this work is 12×12 µm2. Previous studies on CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices have\ndemonstrated scalability down to 200×200 nm2 [24–26]. Due to their filament-type\nnature, the performance of the ReRAM devices presented in this work is expected to\nremain similar for smaller areas."

Subsequently, a closed-loop scheme is initiated,\nwhich iteratively repeats the following two steps until convergence to Gtarget within an\nacceptance range: (1) read the conductance of the ReRAM cell, and (2) if the measured\nvalue is below (above) the target conductance, apply a set (reset) programming pulse.\nDuring this iterative process, the cell conductance may fluctuate multiple times before\neventually reaching the acceptance range. Starting from the HRS, this procedure is\napplied to the CMO/HfOx ReRAM array to sequentially program 35 representative\nconductance levels, ranging from approximately 10 µS to 90 µS, using acceptance\nranges of both 0.2% Gtarget and 2% Gtarget. Unlike the conventional incremental-pulse\nclosed-loop technique previously used for ReRAM [9, 43], where the amplitudes of set\nand reset pulses are gradually increased to achieve convergence, this work employs an\nidentical-pulse closed-loop scheme to simplify the pulse generation circuitry design,\nusing only two fixed amplitude values for the set (1.35 V or 1.5 V) and two for the reset\n(−1.3 V or −1.5 V) pulses. Specifically, depending on Gtarget, three ranges are used:\nfrom approximately 10 µS to 30 µS with Vset = 1.35 V and Vreset = −1.5 V; from 30 µS\nto 60 µS Vset = 1.35 V and Vreset = −1.3 V ; and from 60 µS to 90 µS Vset = 1.5 V and\nVreset = −1.3 V. Fig. S5b in Supplementary Information shows the flowchart of the\nidentical-pulse closed-loop technique used in this work. The set/reset pulse width is\nfixed at 2.5 µs due to setup limitations, even though previous work has demonstrated\nCMO/HfOx ReRAM switching with pulse width as short as 60 ns [25]. The reading\npulse amplitude and width are Vread = 0.2 V and 300 µs, respectively. During the set,\nreset, and read operations of each 1T1R cell, the transistor’s gate voltage is controlled\nwith constant values of VG equal to 1.4 V, 3.3 V, and 3.3 V, respectively."

      "text": "By extracting the standard deviation of the minimum conductance step size (σ∆Gsp)\nfrom the experimental traces and incorporating it into the simulation’s device model,\nthe device response intrinsically includes noise from cycle to cycle. This provides a real-\nistic device behavior with intra-device variability. Furthermore, the network devices\nshall include inter-device variabilities to perform physically accurate simulations. To\nachieve this, two multi-variate Gaussian distributions, G1 and G2, are created (see Fig.\nS9 in Supplementary Information). G1 is extracted from the experimentally obtained\nparameters: Nstates (which accounts for variations across devices in the G-range and\nstep) and SP in the normalized G-range, whereas G2 is fitted to the analytical model\nparameters obtained from the fitted generalized SBM (γ and γup down). Therefore, vari-\nables from G1 showed statistical independence from those of G2. New device instances\nare independently sampled from the two Gaussian distributions to represent synapses\non the DNN layers. The instantiated CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices include variations in\nthe device response, conductance ranges, and asymmetrical behavior, thus providing\na more hardware-aware and realistic scenario for analog training simulation."

Due to the temperature\nand electric field confinement, an effective device area of 200×200 nm2 is considered for the\nsimulation to reduce computational resource demands. c The experimental array forming data\nin the low-voltage linear regime (from 0 to 0.2 V) are fitted to extract the average filament\nradius. d The increase in experimental conductance resulting from a negative voltage sweep\nafter the forming event is modelled as an effective increase in the electrical conductivity of\nthe CMO layer, due to a radial redistribution of defects."
