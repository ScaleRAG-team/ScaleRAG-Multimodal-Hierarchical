"Additionally, a 2-layer LSTM network with 64 memory states each (see Fig. 6c),

"trained with the
experimentally obtained configuration. The performance
is mea-"
"sured using the exponential of the cross-entropy loss,
i.e. the test perplexity metric,"
"which quantifies the certainty of the token prediction. Results in Fig. 6d demonstrate"
"the
capabilities of
complex network
the CMO/HfOx ReRAM technology on more"
"architectures,
such
as LSTMs,
and
computationally
demanding
tasks,
exhibiting"
"performance comparable to the FP-equivalent, with an approximate 0.7% difference"
"in test perplexity."
