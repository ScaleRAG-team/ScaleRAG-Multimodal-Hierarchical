"4.6.2 Modelling the conductance relaxation"
"After programming, the conductance levels exhibit relaxation over time, as shown in"
"Fig. 4. Unlike previous ReRAM drift characterizations reported by Wan et al.
[9] the"
"observed relaxation in CMO/HfOx ReRAM is approximately independent of the initial"
"programmed conductance. Consequently, a new modelling approach in the ’aihwkit’"
"is needed to accurately simulate the conductance relaxation effect, which differs from"
"the methods derived from previous literature on ReRAM [9]. The conductance relax-"
"ation mean and standard deviation are modelled independently of G target and solely"
"as a function of time after programming. The coefficients of the first-order polynomials"

"conductance variations at any given inference time. By doing so, the MVM accuracy"
"can be estimated after a period of time up to 10 years."

includes an asymmetry factor (γup down) to account"
"behavior[38]. However, these two parameters do not have a direct physical equivalence,"
"and therefore, cannot be derived from experimental
traces. Hereby, γ and γup down"
"are obtained for each device through an independent linear fitting of the generalized"

response.
In addition to the analytical parameters of
the"
"generalized SBM, devices
in the
’aihwkit’ are defined by a set of parameters
that"
"can be extracted from experimental
