"CMO/HfOx ReRAM cells, projected for up to 10 years from programming, compared"
"to the expected floating-point
(FP)
result. The results are generated using a single"
"64×64 normally distributed random weight matrix
and 100 normally distributed"
"input vectors within the range [-1, 1] (see ”Methods” section ”HW-aware simulation"
"of analog MVM” for details). Considering the input and output quantization of 6-bit"
"and 8-bit respectively, the inset illustrates the time evolution of the root-mean-square"
"error
(RMSE) of
the simulated analog MVM compared to the FP expected result."
"These results show that the CMO/HfOx ReRAM core enables accurate MVM oper-"
"ations, achieving an RMSE ranging from 0.03 at 1 second to 0.2 at 10 years after"
"programming, compared to the ideal FP case. Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Informa-"
"tion illustrates
the impact of
IR-drop and input/output quantization on the RMSE"
"of an MVM performed on a 64×64 array. Over short time scales (within 1 hour), the"
"primary accuracy bottleneck is the limited input/output quantization of 6-bit and 8-"
"bit, respectively. Over longer periods, relaxation effects become the dominant source"
"of non-ideality.
In a larger 512×512 array,
IR-drop emerges as
the main accuracy"
"bottleneck for analog MVM. Compared to the analog ReRAMs
studied by Wan et"
"al.
[9], who report an experimentally determined RMSE of approximately 0.58 under"
"conditions similar to those of this work, CMO/HfOx ReRAMs demonstrate a poten-"
"tial
improvement
in MVM accuracy by a factor of 20 and 3, 1 second and 10 years"
"after programming,
respectively. The
excellent MVM accuracy results demonstrate"
"the suitability of CMO/HfOx ReRAM devices for long-term AI inference applications,"
"and lay the
foundation for AI
training acceleration, where
short-term forward and"
"backward MVMs are key steps."
