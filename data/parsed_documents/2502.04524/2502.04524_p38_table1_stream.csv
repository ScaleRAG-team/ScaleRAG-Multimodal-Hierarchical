"Device modelling"
"up down parameter"
"The up down parameter is defined for the generalized soft bounds model
in the sim-"
"ulation environment of the ‘aihwkit’ as the directional bias between the up and down"
"update size (∆G+ and ∆G−).
In addition, the minimum step in each direction d is"
"described by the following expression [44]."
"(7)
∆Gd = ∆GSP (1 + dβ + σd−to−d)"
"where d is -1 or 1 depending on the update direction. In contrast, the symmetry point"
"is defined for each device as follows [23]:"
"(8)
SP = [∆G+ − ∆G−]/[∆G+/(bmax − ∆G+/bmin)]"
"Where ∆G+, ∆G− define the minimum step size in the up and down direction respec-"
"tively, and bmax and bmin represent the upper and lower bounds of the conductance."
"Therefore, considering an independent definition of each device (i.e. zero d-to-d vari-"
"ability) and a normalized conductance range between -1 and 1, the symmetry point"
"device-level characteristic and the up down analytical parameter are equivalent."
"Training setup"
"For
result
replicability,
the
experimental
parameters
are
incorporated
into
the"
"simulation environment, where
the Noise-to-Signal Ratio
(NSR)
is
represented by"
"’dw min std’, normalized SP by ‘up down’, normalized maximum and minimum con-"
"ductances by ‘w max’ and ‘w min’ and min conductance step by ‘dw min’."
"From this device model, analog training simulations were performed using AGAD"
"considering a learning rate to update the weights of 1e-2,
‘fast lr’ of 0.1 to update"
"matrix,
‘transfer every’
3
iterations
and
batch
size
of
32. The FP baseline was"
"obtained with SGD training using a learning rate of 1e-3 and batch size of 32."
