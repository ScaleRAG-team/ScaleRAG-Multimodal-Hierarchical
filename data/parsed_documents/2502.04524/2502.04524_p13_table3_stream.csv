"To efficiently tackle deep learning workloads, the analog AI accelerator must not only"
"perform forward and backward passes (MVMs), but most importantly, allow for weight"
"updates
[38]. During backpropagation,
the synaptic weights are modified according"
"to the gradient of
the corresponding layer. Therefore,
the device conductance must"
"be gradually modified in both positive and negative directions
to represent analog"
