"Abstract"
"Analog in-memory computing is an emerging paradigm designed to efficiently"
"accelerate deep neural network workloads. Recent advancements have focused on"
"either
inference or
training acceleration. However, a unified analog in-memory"
"technology platform—capable of on-chip training, weight
retention, and long-"
"term inference
acceleration—has
yet
to
be
reported. This work
presents
an"
"all-in-one analog AI accelerator, combining these capabilities
to enable energy-"
"efficient,
continuously adaptable AI
systems. The platform leverages an array"
"of analog filamentary conductive-metal-oxide
resistive
switching
(CMO)/HfOx"
"memory cells (ReRAM) integrated into the back-end-of-line (BEOL). The array"
"demonstrates
reliable resistive switching with voltage amplitudes below 1.5 V,"
"compatible with advanced technology nodes. The
array’s multi-bit
capability"
"(over 32 stable states) and low programming noise (down to 10 nS) enable a nearly"
"ideal weight transfer process, more than an order of magnitude better than other"
"memristive
technologies.
Inference
performance
is
validated
through matrix-"
"vector multiplication simulations on a 64×64 array, achieving a root-mean-square"
"error
improvement by a factor of 20 at 1 second and 3 at 10 years after pro-"
"gramming, compared to state-of-the-art. Training accuracy closely matching the"
"software equivalent is achieved across different datasets. The CMO/HfOx ReRAM"
