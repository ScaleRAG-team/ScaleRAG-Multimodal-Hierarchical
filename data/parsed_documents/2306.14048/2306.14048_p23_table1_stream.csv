Extended Experiments"
"In this section, our goal
is to demonstrate that H2O can improve the diversity of generated text"
"(mentioned in Section 5.3), throughput is further improved when combined with quantization (men-"
"tioned in Section 5.3), and superior performance to handle extremely long length inputs (up to four"
"middle tokens, mentioned in Section 5.3). Moreover, additional investigations about H2 are reported,"
"including experiments under zero-shot/one-shot inference regime; H2O can also enhance the ""Top-K"""
"baseline; extra results of H2 in attention blocks; the emergence of H2 in MLP blocks as well as its"
"properties."
