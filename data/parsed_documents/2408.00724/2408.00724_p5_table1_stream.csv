"• Majority voting. In this strategy, a set of candidates are generated, and the final answer to the"
"problem is determined by the most frequently occurring answer in all the outputs."
"• Weighted majority voting. This strategy is a variant of majority voting in which the candidates"
"are weighted based on the scores given by the reward model."
"We say a strategy is sampling-based if it uses a standard autoregressive sampling algorithm (e.g.,"
"temperature sampling) to generate the candidate set (greedy search is separate,
in that
it only has a"
"single deterministic candidate). A tree-search variant uses a tree search to generate the candidate"
"set. Before discussing tree-search methods, we analyze sampling-based voting below."
"Theoretical analysis of sampling-based voting.
We present theoretical results on the asymptotic"
"behavior of voting-based strategies given infinite compute in Theorems 1 & 2. Informally, we show"
"that
the accuracy of standard/weighted majority voting converges with infinite samples, and the"
"limit only depends on the distribution modeled by the language model
(and the reward model)."
"This theoretical finding is also aligned with our empirical findings shown in Sec. 4.2, which show"
"saturation at high sampling budgets. The proofs are presented in Appendix A."
"Notations and assumptions.
Let V be a finite vocabulary and V ∗ its Kleene closure,
i.e.,
the set"
"of all strings. Given a problem x, we say a language model answers y to this problem if the model"
"outputs rey where r ∈ V ∗ can be any “reasoning path” and e ∈ V denotes a special token that marks"
"the end of reasoning. We further assume that the answer string is always shorter than L tokens, i.e.,"
"|y| ≤ L for some fixed L ∈ N∗ where |y| denotes the length of y. For a language model π, denote"
"by π(v|w) the probability of generating v given input (prompt) w. For a reward model ρ, denote by"
"ρ(v) the score it assigns to the string v. We use I to denote the indicator function."
"Theorem 1. Consider a dataset D = {(xi, yi)}m
i=1 where xi and yi denotes input and true answer,"
