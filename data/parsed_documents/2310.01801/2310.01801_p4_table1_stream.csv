"also consider four fundamental KV cache compression policies. While we mainly use these four"
"fundamental KV cache compression policies for evaluation in this study,
it
is easy for FastGen to"
"use numerous other strategies. The four KV cache compression policies are:"
"• Special Tokens. We keep in KV cache only special
tokens, such as the begin-of-the-sentence"
"token <s>, the instruction token [INST], and so on. This policy is referred to as Cspecial."
"• Punctuation. We keep in the KV cache only punctuation tokens like ”.”, ”:”, ”?”. This policy is"
"referred to as Cpunct.."
"• Locality This policy evicts long-range contexts. Once the relative distance between the context"
"token and the current token exceeds a threshold, the KV cache of the context token will be evicted."
"The threshold is determined by a pre-defined ratio rl of the length budget of local context over the"
"input sequence length. This policy is referred to as Clocal."
"• Frequency (Heavy Hitter) This policy has been used in multiple previous studies (e.g., Sheng"
"et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a). We monitor
for each token its cumulative"
"sum of attention score, then treat these scores as token frequency and only keep the most frequent"
