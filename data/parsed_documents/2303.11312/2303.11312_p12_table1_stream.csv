"As previously mentioned, functions from waywiser are both type- and size-stable, guaranteeing"
"that the outputs from a function will always be of a known data type and of known dimensions."
"For model agreement metrics and global autocorrelation statistics, this means that the output"
"from waywiser will always be a tibble with one row (or,
for grouped data frames, one row"
"per group). This behavior changes
for
local autocorrelation metrics, however:
rather
than"
"returning a single row,
local autocorrelation functions return a tibble with as many rows as"
"there are observations in data (or values in truth and estimate, for the _vec variants). These"
"estimates are ordered in the same order as the input data frame, meaning that the outputs"
"from these functions can be used with cbind() to associate an autocorrelation estimate with"
"its corresponding observation."
