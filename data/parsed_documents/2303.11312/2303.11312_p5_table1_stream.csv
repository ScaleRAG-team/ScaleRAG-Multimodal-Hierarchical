"under a null model) the fractional term simpliﬁes to 1 and thus AC is 0.
In practice however,"
"the null model
is not the true lower bound for how poorly two data sets can agree with one"
"another;

is entirely possible for poor models with large diﬀerences between yi and ˆyi"
"produce negative AC estimates, with true bounds of (−∞, 1]. Worse agreement between yi"
"and y produces smaller values."
"In addition to these dimensionless agreement metrics,
these authors also suggest a host of"
"metrics for model assessment in units of y, which may then be decomposed into systematic and"
"unsystematic components. For instance, Willmott (1981) walks through the decomposition"
"of the familiar mean squared error (MSE):"
"1 n
nX i
MSE =
(5)
(ˆyi − yi)2"
"=1"
"Into its
systematic and unsystematic components, with the systematic component of MSE"
"given by:"
""
"1 n
nX i
(6)
MSEs =
(cid:0)ˆyi − y0"
"=1"
