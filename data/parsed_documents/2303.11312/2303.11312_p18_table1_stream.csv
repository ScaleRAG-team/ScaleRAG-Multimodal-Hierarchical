waywiser: Ergonomic Methods for Assessing Spatial Models"
"A challenge with requiring
for
input data
is
that
it
requires
all
observations
sf objects"
"be
loaded into memory before any aggregations
can be
calculated, which poses problems"
"for modeling eﬀorts with large numbers of
relatively small observation units
such as high-"
"resolution landscape or global models.
Such eﬀorts
typically rely on raster
formats
for ef-"
"ﬁciency, and avoid transforming rasters
into vector
representations whenever possible. As"
"such, ww_multi_scale() can also be used to calculate performance metrics using raster in-"
"puts.
If data is NULL or missing, users can provide SpatRaster objects from the terra package"
"(Hijmans 2023) to both truth and estimate in order to perform a multi-scale assessment."
"Aggregation for this method is performed using the exactextractr package (Baston 2022) for"
"memory and computational eﬃciency. Other than the slightly diﬀerent interface and using ex-"
"actextractr for aggregation, this method of ww_multi_scale() works identically and returns"
"an identical output to the sf method."
