"This
formulation means
that d is bounded [0, 1], with higher values of d indicating greater"
"agreement between y and ˆy. As a dimensionless metric, d is a useful tool for comparing models;"
"however,
the use of
summed diﬀerences
in the numerator means
that d is oversensitive to"
"(1985)
outliers in ˆyi −yi (Legates and McCabe 1999). To address this concern, Willmott et al."
"introduced a revised metric named d1, using the sum of the absolute values of diﬀerences in"
"the place of the sum of squared diﬀerences and no longer squaring the denominator:"

As with d, d1"
"(2011) notes that d1 approaches 1 more slowly than d, allowing for ﬁner-grained comparisons"
"between well-performing models."
"Willmott et al. revisited these indices twenty-ﬁve years later (2011), noting that interpretation"
"of d and d1 was made diﬃcult both by the limited range of the metric and by the inclusion"
"of ˆy in the denominator, which made the scaling factor of the agreement metric dependent"
"upon the model
itself. To address this, they introduce a new metric dr, such that:"
