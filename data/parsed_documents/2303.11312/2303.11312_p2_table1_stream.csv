waywiser: Ergonomic Methods for Assessing Spatial Models"
"reduce some of the cognitive load associated with switching between diﬀerent tasks (Roehm"
"et al. 2012). User interfaces should also make it easy to follow scientiﬁc and statistical best"
"practices, and similarly make it diﬃcult
to commit methodological errors
(Kuhn and Silge"
"2022)."
"Many excellent R packages aim to help reduce this complexity and promote best practices"
"by addressing individual aspects of model
evaluation.
Among many others, packages
like"
"yardstick (Kuhn et al. 2023), metrica (Correndo et al. 2022), and hydroGOF (Zambrano-"
"Bigiarini 2020) provide suites of metrics for model assessment, providing standard interfaces"
"for calculating model accuracy and agreement given vectors of observed and predicted values."
"Packages like spdep (Bivand and Wong 2018) and rgeoda (Li and Anselin 2023), meanwhile,"
"provide measures of spatial autocorrelation, helping modelers assess the spatial distribution of"
"model errors. Finally, several packages implement additional evaluation approaches beyond"
"standard error assessments; for instance, CAST (Meyer et al. 2023) and applicable (Gotti and"
"Kuhn 2022) implement approaches for calculating model applicability domains."
"The new waywiser package implements elements of each of these approaches, while provid-"
"ing a consistent, ergonomic user interface for each aspect of model assessment. Functions in"
"waywiser provide new implementations of several popular assessment metrics from the spatial"
"modeling literature, and provide a wrapper around functions for calculating spatial autocor-"
"relation metrics. Additional
functions provide an approach for assessing model predictions"
"aggregated to multiple spatial
scales, and a new implementation of
the dissimilarity index"
"and area of applicability from Meyer and Pebesma (2021). These functions share a consistent"
"interface, with standardized argument names and deﬁnitions, making it easy for users to learn"
"how to use the package, and to switch between evaluation approaches as desired."
"Outputs from waywiser are both type-stable and size-stable, making waywiser functions both"
"predictable and easy to program with. Functions in waywiser additionally accept inputs and"
"return outputs using standard classes, using objects
from the popular
sf
(Pebesma 2018)"
"package for spatial data and simple data frames and vectors otherwise. This predictability"
"and reliance on well-established classes makes it easy to use waywiser with the majority of"
"modeling tools in R. Additional
features make it particularly easy to combine waywiser with"
"packages in the tidymodels modeling framework (Kuhn and Silge 2022). For instance, while"
"waywiser does not
itself provide any functions
for performing cross-validation or hyperpa-"
"rameter selection,
functions from waywiser integrate naturally with the tune package (Kuhn"
"2022b), allowing for cross-validated model assessment using data splits from rsample (Frick"
"et al. 2022) and spatialsample (Mahoney and Silge 2023) and automated hyperparameter"
"selection using dials (Kuhn and Frick 2022)."
"The rest of
this article walks
through features
in waywiser,
starting with functions

"menting (or wrapping implementations of) model assessment metrics (Section 3),
followed by"
"methods for assessing model performance when aggregating predictions across multiple spa-"
"tial scales (Section 4), then by functions for calculating the applicability domain of a model"
"(Section 5). An additional
section discusses how waywiser
integrates with the tidymodels"
"modeling framework (Section 6)."
