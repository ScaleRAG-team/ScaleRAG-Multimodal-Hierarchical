"In this way, waywiser
functions are designed to integrate naturally with packages
in the"
"tidymodels ecosystem, extending the consistent user-friendly interfaces of those packages for"
"spatial model assessment tasks. However, as emphasized at the start of this section, waywiser"
"functions are designed to be framework-agnostic and also accept standard data frames and"
"vectors as
inputs, while
returning standard data frames and vectors as outputs wherever"
"possible.
In this way, waywiser aims to be maximally interoperable with as many modeling"
"workï¬‚ows as possible."
