"Abstract"
"Assessing predictive models can be challenging. Modelers must navigate a wide array"
"of
evaluation methodologies
implemented with incompatible
interfaces across multiple"
"packages which may give diﬀerent or even contradictory results, while ensuring that their"
"chosen approach properly estimates
the performance of
their model when generalizing"
"to new observations. Assessing models ﬁt
to spatial data can be particularly diﬃcult,"
"given that model errors may exhibit spatial autocorrelation, model predictions are often"
"aggregated to multiple
spatial
scales by end users,
and models are often tasked with"
"generalizing into spatial regions outside the boundaries of their initial training data."
"The waywiser package for the R language attempts to make assessing spatial models"
"easier by providing an ergonomic toolkit
for model evaluation tasks, with functions
for"
"multiple assessment methodologies sharing a uniﬁed interface. Functions from waywiser"
"share standardized argument names and default values, making the user-facing interface"
"simple and easy to learn. These functions are additionally designed to be easy to inte-"
"grate into a wide variety of modeling workﬂows, accepting standard classes as inputs and"
"returning size- and type-stable outputs, ensuring that their results are of consistent and"
"predictable data types and dimensions. Additional
features make it particularly easy to"
"use waywiser along packages and workﬂows in the tidymodels ecosystem."
