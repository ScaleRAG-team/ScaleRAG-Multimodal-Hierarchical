"Figure 16
Left: We characterize the step on which early stopping occurs, as a function of the extent of"
"overﬁtting. The red line indicates a lower bound for early stopping that
is derived in Section 5.3. Right:"
"We display train and test
loss for a series of 300M parameter models trained on different sized dataset sub-"
"samples. The test loss typically follows that of a run done with unrestricted data until diverging. Note that the"
"degree of overﬁtting (as compared to the inﬁnite data limit) is signiﬁcantly overestimated by Ltest − Ltrain"
"(denoted by a black bar for each run)."
