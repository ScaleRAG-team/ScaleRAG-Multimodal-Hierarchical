"B.3
Comparison to Inefﬁcient",""
"Typically, researchers train models until they appear to be close to convergence.","In this section, we compare"
"the efﬁcient training procedure described above to this more typical setup. We deﬁne a the convergence factor",""
"f as the percent deviation from the converged loss:",""
"L (N, C) = (1 + f ) L (N, ∞) .","(B.11)"
"For compute-efﬁcient
training we have f = αN /αS ≈ 10% from the previous section, but","researchers"
"","typically use a much smaller value. Here, we choose f (cid:48) = 2% as an estimate. For a ﬁxed value of the loss,"
"we predict:",""
